We will publish instructions here on how to integrate our devices most easily into HomeKit using the interfaces mentioned above.

[WARP Charger](/warp_charger/introduction.md) or [WARP Energy Manager](/warp_energy_manager/introduction.md) have various interfaces
for integration into other systems. These include:

* [MQTT/HTTP API](/interfaces/mqtt_http/introduction.md)
* [Modbus/TCP](/interfaces/modbus/introduction.md)
