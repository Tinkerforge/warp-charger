# ioBroker

:::note
Coming soon...
:::

There is an adapter for ioBroker: [Link](https://github.com/pottio/ioBroker.warp) ([Tinkerunity](https://www.tinkerunity.org/topic/7563-warp-in-iobroker/)).
We will document its usage here soon.

Alternatively, [WARP Charger](/warp_charger/introduction.md) and [WARP Energy Manager](/warp_energy_manager/introduction.md) have various interfaces
for integration into other systems. These include:

* [MQTT/HTTP API](/interfaces/mqtt_http/introduction.md)
* [Modbus/TCP](/interfaces/modbus/introduction.md)
