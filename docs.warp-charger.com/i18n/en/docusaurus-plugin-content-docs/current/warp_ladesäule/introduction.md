# Introduction

With the WARP Charger Stand, we offer a high-quality mounting option for our [WARP Charger](/warp_charger/introduction.md) wallboxes. One WARP Charger wallbox can be mounted on the front of the stand.
Depending on the version, a second WARP Charger wallbox can also be mounted on the back. A subsequent upgrade from one to two wallboxes is conceivable, as only the rear part of the stand needs to be replaced.

Using the included mounting aid, the foundation for the stand including cable entry can be prepared. After curing, the stand can simply be screwed onto the mounting aid. The mounting aid guides a conduit or
directly the supply lines into the column. The mounting screws are internal and thus protected from external access. The column has a split rear wall. Via the lower part of the rear wall, the supply lines are easily accessible
and connection of the column is simple.

If desired, the stand can be ordered pre-wired, so that the supply line only needs to be connected in a distribution box already installed in the stand.

## Variants

The WARP Charger Stand is available in two different variants:

### Variant V4A Stainless Steel

This stand is made of 1.5mm thick V4A stainless steel.

## Access Protection

The WARP Charger Stand has two doors on the back. Each door is secured with two rotary latches.
If access needs to be protected, these doors can be fitted with locks. These are offered as accessories.

At least two locks per stand are required. Each lock secures one door on the
back by replacing a rotary latch with a lock.

The wallboxes can be opened with a screwdriver. If these should also be protected from access,
special security screws can be used. Only with the included special bit can the screws then be turned.
These security screws are also available as accessories.
