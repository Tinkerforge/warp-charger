# Assembly and Installation

### Scope of Delivery

The stand delivery includes:
-   Stand
-   If pre-assembled: Selected WARP3 Charger wallboxes incl. accessories
-   Mounting materials
    -   1x mounting aid
    -   4x M8 screws
    -   4x washers
    -   8x M8 nuts
-   Operating manual, operating manuals and test protocols of the
    wallboxes

### Installation Location

The following requirements must be met for mounting the WARP Charger Stand:
-   The installation location must meet all requirements listed in the WARP3
Charger operating manual.
-   When installing the stand on a street or
public parking lot, open or covered, appropriate
impact/ram protection must be installed.
-   If multiple stands are to be installed side by side, the
distance between the individual stands must be at least 200 mm.
-   The surface must be completely level.

Do not install the stand on asphalt! Stability cannot be
guaranteed on asphalt.

### Creating the Foundation

A concrete foundation is recommended for safe installation of the stand.
Design, construction and execution of the foundation are
the responsibility of the concrete foundation manufacturer and must be adapted
to local conditions if necessary.

The concrete foundation size of 250 mm x 470 mm x 800 mm should be considered the minimum size
to ensure stable standing.

The mounting aid must be assembled as specified with the supplied screws,
washers and nuts. The specified dimensions must
be observed. Then the assembled mounting aid can be
positioned in the concrete foundation.

Water must not accumulate at the foundation; it must be able to drain away.
The power supply cables, a grounding cable and any
existing network cables must exit at the center of the concrete foundation
and have a protruding length of at least 1500 mm. For this purpose,
there is an oval recess in the mounting aid with external dimensions of
75 × 35 mm. The foundation manufacturer must ensure adequate protection
of the cables. Protective sleeves must protrude at least 300 mm from the concrete.
A grounding connection is mandatory.

### Mounting the Stand

After the concrete foundation has been poured and cured, the
stand can be mounted. The rear panels should be removed first.
The upper M8 nuts (4 pieces) and washers used in the mounting aid
must now be unscrewed again so that the threads are exposed.
Then the column can be positioned centrally over the
cables protruding from the foundation. The
embedded mounting aid ensures correct positioning of the
mounting screws. After placing the column on the screws,
it can be screwed to the foundation using the previously removed
washers and nuts.

## Electrical Connection

The electrical connection of the wallboxes is made separately
for each wallbox. The electrical installation notes for the WARP3 Charger from
the [Assembly and Installation Manual](/warp_charger/assembly_and_installation.md#installation-location) must be observed.

### Requirements for Electrical Installation

The requirements for [electrical installation](/warp_charger/assembly_and_installation.md#requirements-for-electrical-installation) of the selected WARP3 Charger
wallboxes must be observed.

### Electrical Installation

Each wallbox can be ordered from the factory with a connection cable and
connected distribution box. The following describes this variant. Alternatively,
the stand can be ordered without pre-installation. The distribution boxes
are then missing and the wallboxes must be connected directly.

The distribution box contains terminals of type SRK 10 or
comparable. Single and multi-core conductors with a
cross-section of up to 16 mm² and conductors with ferrules with a
cross-section of up to 10 mm² can be connected. The stripping length
is 10 mm. Connection is made according to the labeling of the terminals
in the distribution box.

Subsequently, the [tests required in the WARP3 Charger operating manual](/warp_charger/assembly_and_installation.md#testing) must be performed for the wallboxes.

### Grounding

The stand must definitely be grounded. For this purpose, there is a
grounding point in the column at wallbox height. This must be
connected and the grounding verified.

### RJ45 - Ethernet

A distribution box is also used for connecting the Ethernet cable.
The existing Ethernet cables of the wallbox can be connected
in the box.
