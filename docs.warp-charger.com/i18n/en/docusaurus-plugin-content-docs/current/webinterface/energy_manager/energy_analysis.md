# Energy Balance

:::note

This setting is only available for the [WARP Energy Manager 2.0](/warp_energy_manager/introduction.md).

:::

The [WARP Energy Manager 2.0](/warp_energy_manager/introduction.md) records
the data of the configured energy meters internally. The recorded values can be
viewed on this page.

At the top right, you can switch from a **daily view** to a **monthly view**.


### Daily View

In the daily view, the power values of the configured energy meters are displayed for the selected
day. If dynamic electricity prices are configured, they are also shown.
The screenshot was recorded around 17:00, so the electricity prices for the day are shown,
but not the future meter values.

Below the graph, an energy balance of the meter values for the selected day is displayed.

### Monthly View

In the monthly view, the daily summaries are displayed, as well as the minimum/mean and maximum
of the electricity price, if configured. The screenshot was recorded on 02/26,
so for 02/26 the values for the day so far are displayed. The remaining days of the month are
in the future, so the dynamic electricity prices are not yet determined and no energy meter readings are available.

Below the graph, an energy balance of the meter values for the selected month is displayed.
