# Debug

![image](/img/webinterface/energy_manager/wem2-debug.jpeg)

An Energy Manager log can be created on the debug page. This is helpful for diagnosing any problems
with energy distribution. To create a log, simply click **Start**.
The Energy Manager then begins to record all states at high frequency. With **Stop+Download**,
the recording can be stopped and the created log downloaded.

Under **Internal State** and **Low-Level State**,
internal states of the Energy Manager are displayed, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.
