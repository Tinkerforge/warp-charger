The content of six tiles can be configured on the display
of the WARP Energy Manager 2.0.

Information can be displayed, for example, about power meters, the current
dynamic electricity price, status of the SG-Ready output (heater), or the
current PV forecast. If desired, the display
can also be disabled.
