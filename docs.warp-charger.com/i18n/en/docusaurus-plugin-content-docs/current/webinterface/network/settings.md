Here, the *hostname* of the [WARP Charger](/warp_charger/introduction.md) or [WARP Energy Manager](/warp_energy_manager/introduction.md) can be configured for all
connected networks. Additionally, *mDNS* can be enabled or disabled. Via mDNS, other devices on the network can find the WARP3 Charger/WARP Energy Manager.
This simplifies, for example, the setup of a load management cluster. Additionally, the *port* on which the web interface is accessible can be changed (default is port 80).
