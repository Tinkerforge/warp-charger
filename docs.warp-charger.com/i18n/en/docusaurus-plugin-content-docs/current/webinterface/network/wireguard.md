# WireGuard

With WireGuard, the [WARP Charger](/warp_charger/introduction.md) or [WARP Energy Manager](/warp_energy_manager/introduction.md) can be integrated into a virtual private network (VPN) using an encrypted connection. WireGuard
is directly supported by various routers. The VPN can be used, for example, to access the device remotely.

The necessary parameters are WireGuard-specific and are not
explained separately here. Further information can be found at
https://www.wireguard.com.

further configuration can be performed.
