# WiFi Connection

:::note

There is a tutorial that also covers integrating a [WARP Charger](/warp_charger/introduction.md) or [WARP Energy Manager](/warp_energy_manager/introduction.md) into a network: [First Steps](/tutorials/first_steps.md)

By pressing the *Network Search* button, a menu opens where the desired WiFi network can be selected.
The network name (SSID) and BSSID are then automatically entered, and the connection is activated on restart. If necessary, the passphrase of the
selected network must now be entered. Additionally, the IP configuration (DHCP, static) can be set and a reception optimization can be enabled. The reception optimization
then uses the old 802.11b mode.

:::note

The LAN and WiFi connections should not be connected simultaneously to the same network or IP range, as this can lead to connection problems.
