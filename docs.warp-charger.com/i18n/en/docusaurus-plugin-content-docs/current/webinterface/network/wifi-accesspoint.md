# WiFi Access Point

:::note

There is a tutorial that also covers integrating a [WARP Charger](/warp_charger/introduction.md) or [WARP Energy Manager](/warp_energy_manager/introduction.md) into a network: [First Steps](/tutorials/first_steps.md)

The access point can be operated in one of two modes: Either it can always be active or only
when the connection to another WiFi or LAN is not configured or has failed.
Additionally, the access point can be completely disabled.


:::note

We recommend never completely disabling the access point, as otherwise the web interface cannot be reached
if the connection to another network fails.

:::


The mode of the access point, network name, passphrase, etc. should be self-explanatory and can be configured here.

:::note

Routing between the access point and the other network (LAN, WiFi) is not supported. The access point therefore cannot be used to replace a WiFi access point that connects to a LAN.
