# Event Log

![image](/img/webinterface/system/warp-system_event_log.jpeg)

The event log records relevant information from system startup, as well as Wi-Fi and MQTT connection failures and control information.
If problems occur with a [WARP Charger](/warp_charger/introduction.md) or [WARP Energy Manager](/warp_energy_manager/introduction.md), they can be diagnosed using the log. If you want to report a problem with the WARP Energy Manager to us,
you can retrieve and send us a debug report. This can help us understand and resolve the problem.
The debug report includes the event log and the complete device configuration, with the exception of passwords and similar sensitive data.
