# Firmware Update

In general, we recommend performing an update of the WARP Charger firmware or WARP Energy Manager firmware
after installation and when new firmware releases are available,
to receive the latest features and any bug fixes.

With the "Check for update" button, the system can automatically search for new firmware.
If found, it can also be installed with the push of a button. This function requires an internet connection
from the WARP Charger or WARP Energy Manager.

If no internet connection is available, a firmware file can also be manually uploaded and installed.
