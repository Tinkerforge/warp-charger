# Settings

Here you can configure the system language. Alternatively, it is possible for the [WARP Charger](/warp_charger/introduction.md) or [WARP Energy Manager](/warp_energy_manager/introduction.md) to
determine the system language using the browser language. It is possible to restart the device with the push of a button.
If the web interface is not working correctly, or the configuration is defective, you can reset all settings to factory defaults here.

:::note

Resetting to factory defaults will erase all configurations.

:::

After resetting, the web interface will start again and open the access point with the SSID and passphrase
noted on the sticker. The device can now be configured again as in the tutorial [First Steps](/tutorials/first_steps.md).
